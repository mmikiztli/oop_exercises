# Car Dealer

Create the following classes to make the tests run:
- Vehicle
- Truck
- Car

## Vehicle
Place all the common properties into this "parent" object

## Truck
Add extra carriage related functions - see the test and test results for more details

## Car
Add the engine related (is_running, start_engine, stop_engine) parameter and functions to this class. Yes, a Truck should be also able to start it's engine, but it's not the main purpose now :)
